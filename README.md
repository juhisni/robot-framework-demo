# robot-framework-demo
Basic example of Robot Framework test cases

## Usage ##
Execute test case by:
1) Navigating to project directory (robot-framework-demo) on command prompt.  
2) Running windows batch-file (.bat) on command prompt by typing: runallRF.bat Browser Tag  
FOR EXAMPLE runallRF.bat Chrome demo  
This command will run all test cases with a tag called "demo" on Chrome.  
3) Test results can be accessed from the robot-results directory.

# NOTE #
Currently the test case fails because the steps were created in Spring 2018.  
XAMK's website layout and element attributes have changed since.
